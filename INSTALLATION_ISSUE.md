# üö® IMPORTANT: Installation Method Change

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue with HACS Installation

Unfortunately, **HACS is not the ideal way** to install this complete Home Assistant configuration because:

- ‚ùå HACS downloads to `www/community/` folder (wrong location)
- ‚ùå HACS doesn't replace configuration files (for safety)
- ‚ùå This is a **complete configuration**, not a single component

## ‚úÖ **Recommended Installation Method**

### **Option 1: Direct Download (Easiest)**

1. **Download the ZIP file directly:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/juangarcia0482/home-assistance
   - Click **"Code"** ‚Üí **"Download ZIP"**

2. **Extract and copy files:**
   - Extract the ZIP file on your computer
   - Copy the files to your Home Assistant config folder

### **Option 2: Git Clone (Advanced)**

```bash
# Backup your current config first!
cd /config
git clone https://github.com/juangarcia0482/home-assistance.git temp-config
cp -r temp-config/* .
rm -rf temp-config
```

### **Option 3: Manual File Copy**

1. **Backup your current configuration**
2. **Download individual files** from the GitHub repository
3. **Copy them to your config folder**

## üîß **If You Already Used HACS**

Since you already downloaded via HACS, let's fix it:

1. **Find the files in:** `/config/www/community/home-assistance/`
2. **Copy all files** from that folder to your main `/config/` folder
3. **Merge folders** like `custom_components/` and `www/`
4. **Replace your configuration.yaml** with the new one
5. **Edit the new configuration** with your settings

## üìã **Updated Installation Guide**

I'll create a new installation guide that doesn't rely on HACS for the main configuration files.

**Sorry for the confusion!** HACS works great for individual components, but complete configurations need a different approach.
